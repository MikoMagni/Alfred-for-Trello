##Setup

1. Use the keyword "<b>jello</b>" to authorise Alfred for Trello to access your Trello information.
2. Copy the **token** generated by Trello.com
3. Open the Afred for Trello Workflow and enter the token in /bin/bash script: **token=''**
4. Go to your Trello.com board that you wish to use and copy the **Board ID**. You can find the Board ID just before your board name. For example: https://trello.com/b/<b>4f21cb176603c3</b>/yourname/       
5. In the example above <b>4f21cb176603c3</b> is the board id.
6. Enter the Board ID in /bin/bash script: **boardid=''**
7. Within the Alfred for Trello workflow double click the Hotkey and set "Option + Command + t" or your preferred hotkey.


###Optional
You can specifify a list within your Trello board. 
Simply open the /bin/bash script within the workflow and enter the name of the list. For example if your list name is inbox enter:  **listname='inbox'**.
If you leave it blank **listname=''** the first list within your board will be used as default list.
